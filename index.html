                    <div class = "letter-body">
                   <p class="underline-text">As requested here is an overview of my business proposal for a Mexican themed restaurant along Rembrandt Blvd.
                  </p>

                      This location has lots of heavy pedestrian foot traffic in the daytime from the neighboring shopping strip to the north, and at nighttime from the bar and nightclub strip to the south. I therefore propose two distinct target demographics - daytime shoppers who want lunch or larger meals towards the evening, and late night pedestrians going to and from the bars and clubs.
                      I believe that we can get the best of both worlds, while being the first to offer Mexican food in the area. The low quality takeouts tend not to do well in the day against the up market restaurants, though those same restaurants close in the evening giving their business to the takeouts. With this in mind I propose a comprehensive Mexican menu in the day, with the full restaurant experience, and then at night the main building gets closed off and customers are directed to a fast food counter/window serving nachos, burritos and similar snacks.</p>
